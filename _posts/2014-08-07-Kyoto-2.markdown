__7/12 Kyoto Day Two__

This day on our trip will forever be remembered as the backbreaking sightseeing day. We tried to pack a week’s worth of activities in Kyoto into a weekend, and the majority of them on this day. Katie has an app that tells you how far you’ve walked in a day, and by the end of this day we walked a total of about 10 miles. Had I anticipated this, I would not have worn my flip-flops. We started off the morning with a brief run along the river. We were going to run 10 miles, but woke up too late and said we’d do it tomorrow (oh how naive we were). We ate breakfast in our hotel. Well, at least Kristina, Katie, and I did. Tim headed to the closest convenience store for his diet of rice balls and raw fish.

We hopped on the subway and then a bus to a place called Kinkakuji, or the Golden Pavilion. It’s a Zen Buddhist Temple and the outside is covered in gold leaf. It’s a beautiful and spectacular sight.

We spent time taking pictures and wandering around the grounds. Just like all the temples and shrines we’ve visited, there are extensive grounds with gardens, mini shrines, teahouses, halls, etc. And, there’s always some kind of place to make an offering or a wish. These candles you could purchase, light, and leave at one of the altars. We got a kick out of some of the wishes.

One of the recommended sites to see in Japan is a Japanese Garden, so we next headed to the Kyoto Botanical Gardens. These gardens are extensive, and due to time we probably only saw about ½ or ⅔ of the gardens. They have lots of paths to explore with different types of gardens including water lily pond, lotus pond, maple, ume garden, Japanese Garden, Rose Garden, Bamboo Garden, European Garden, and a conservatory with 8 separate types of gardens within it as well. Our favorite was the air-conditioned garden. :) Also, some of the gardens weren’t blooming much because of the season. I’m sure it’s a great place to visit anytime of year though.

We rushed to find a place to eat lunch after this, so we could make our scheduled walking tour of Kyoto. Katie had done one before when visiting with her husband Paul, and she said it was a great way to find out more information than she could give us. It basically ended up being a private tour as it was just one guide leading the four of us around. His English was great and he definitely gave us a lot of information. He had lived in the US before in Colorado, and at one point biked from South America (I can’t remember which country he started in) to Canada.  

We started off the walking tour by visiting the Fushimi Inari Shrine. This at first seems like a typical shrine. There are many fox statues at the entrance to the shrine, but also throughout the shrine.

This shrine is most famous for its path/hike with thousands of torii gates covering the path. Torii gates usually are just at the entrance to a shrine, so this is quite remarkable seeing so many of them cover a path. It’s almost like walking through a tunnel because they are placed so close together. We only did part of the path because the whole thing would have taken 2-3 hours. There’s supposed to be a nice view at the top. If we had ACTUALLY had a week in Kyoto, then perhaps we would have done the whole thing.

Next we headed to Tofukuji Temple, which has maple trees that are apparently really beautiful in the fall. While we weren’t able to see the fall colors, we were able to experience the 4 gardens within the temple, including a rock garden.

Now just imagine this picture with fall colors

For our last stop on our walking tour, our guide took us to Gion in hopes to spot some Geisha. It was around 5pm, and apparently this is when you can spot them (and one of the areas where they live/work) going to or from some kind of event. In Kyoto, geisha are actually called geiko, and their apprentices are called meiko. We ended up seeing 9 of them in total. At least one was a meiko. It felt a little weird just standing around waiting for them. Especially because when one would appear, everyone would scurry around her and try to take her picture. We felt a little like the paparazzi. But, it was pretty cool to see them. You have to be quick, because they scurry surprisingly fast for the outfits they’re wearing. Girls decide at a fairly young age if they want to be a geiko, and go into training. So, the meiko we saw was probably around 15 or 16. This area of the city is really neat looking as well because the buildings are constructed in a traditional old fashioned way, that you imagine Japan looked like hundreds of years ago.

After our walking tour, we went to a teahouse where we experienced a shortened version of a Japanese tea ceremony. A typical ceremony is about 4 hours long - ours was 45. Unfortunately we were not allowed to take photos. But, it was a group of about 12 tourists, including us, sitting down in this traditional tea house, while a Japanese woman in formal dress, told us about the ceremony, then went through the ceremony with us. First, you eat a Japanese sweet or cake. This is more like candy, not like the cake we eat in the U.S. The biggest thing about Japanese tea, is it’s a green powdery substance - not leaves. The leaves have already been crushed down to make this powder, which is apparently more caffeinated than coffee. You pour hot water into your mug, and have to whisk the mug as briskly as possible. Tim, of course, was good at this, while the woman leading the group had to help me whisk mine sufficiently. Then, there’s a proper way to hold the in the palm of one hand, then you turn the mug a few times before you start drinking. You’re supposed to drink the whole thing in 3 sips. And, the last sip you’re supposed to make a loud slurping noise, to show your host that you enjoyed the tea. The green tea is called Macha, and it’s delicious! It’s a bright green color, so unlike the green tea we typically drink here. It was definitely a worthwhile experience.

We were hungry after the tea ceremony, and then Tim and I fully got to experience the difficulty that can be had finding food in Japan. Even though there are restaurants EVERYWHERE (Japan has more restaurants per capita than anywhere else in the world), it can be surprisingly difficult to find somewhere to eat. I’m sure this was only exacerbated by our dietary restrictions. So far on the trip, we’d been lucky. But this evening was difficult. Places can be too crowded to seat people, or nothing is in English, or it’s expensive, or there’s nothing on the menu that looks appetizing. Plus, we were already tired, hungry, and my back was killing me from walking around all day in flip-flops. I’m not exaggerating when I say it took us about 2 hours to find a place to eat. It was pretty painful. This is a large reason why Tim started eating mainly at 7-11 and other convenience stores. He could find things that were safe for him (lots of rice balls without any soy sauce). But luckily that night, we were granted with an awesome view of the Kyoto Tower after our dinner. .

Needless to say, a 10 mile run was NOT in the cards for the next morning. But, we saw some amazing sights in Kyoto that day.
