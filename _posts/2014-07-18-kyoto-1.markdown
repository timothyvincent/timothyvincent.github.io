__7/11  Kyoto Day 1__

We awoke to Mt. Fuji peeking out above some clouds, which is a rare sight in the summer. And it meant that the typhoon had officially passed!

We made breakfast and headed to the train station to depart for Kyoto. Exchanging our JR (Japan Rail) passes ended up being a little more of an ordeal than anticipated. These are passes only foreigners can buy and it’s a much cheaper way to travel around the country. We thought it would be a quick exchange, but we waited for a long time and then they took about 30 minutes scrutinizing each detail to make sure we were who we said we were. But, then we were off on the Shinkansen, or bullet train from Yokohama to Kyoto. The United States really needs to adopt some kind of bullet train system, or better train system in general. It’s a simple, efficient way to travel.

We were in a rush to grab our train, so I grabbed the least meaty looking Bento box I could find. It was an experience for sure. Luckily, Kristina grabbed the same one and taste tested a couple items before I ate them. Only one ended up being meaty. I tried for the first time a lotus root (swiss cheese looking thing a little hidden in the upper left portion) and I’ve now had one a few different times in different dishes and served in a multitude of ways: fresh, stir fried, fried, etc. It’s pretty good. One of the grossest things I ate was in the upper right box - a green gelatinous, a little salty tasting. I thought it was in the dessert section, and was sorely disappointed. It was a fairly good experience overall.

By the time we got to Kyoto and checked into our hotel we still had some of the afternoon left to explore. So, our official tour guide, Katie took us to a couple nearby highlights of Kyoto. The first was Toji temple, which in addition to housing some shrines and halls has the largest pagoda in Japan. It’s 5 stories and was originally built in 826. Every temple and shrine we’ve visited has more than just a simple shrine or temple where people worship. There are always extensive grounds to explore, often with ponds, lotus flowers, gardens, multiple mini shrines and statues, etc. This one was no exception, although it did have less than some. Also, the lotus flowers here are HUGE. Way bigger than any place I’ve ever seen. Each shrine and temple has been beautiful and peaceful. (With an exception to the peaceful part for some of the temples overrun with tourists.)

We then visited Kyoto Tower, where we could get a birdseye view of the city. This included a view of Toji Temple.

For dinner we went to the best little sushi place I’ve ever been. We sat at a counter right next to the chef and watched as he assembled our meal. Also, as people entered and exited the restaurant the people would yell a greeting as they came and went. I have no idea what they were saying, but it was a great atmosphere.
