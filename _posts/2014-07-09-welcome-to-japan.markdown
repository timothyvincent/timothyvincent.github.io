Today is our first day in Japan.  Our body clocks are predictably broken, but we're feeling pretty good.  Pulling Cami away from Koda wasn't as difficult as I'd expected, thanks mostly to knowing that he'll be in good hands with Geoff.

We had a mostly uneventful flight, though we were informed as we were boarding that Delta would not have the vegetarian non-dairy meals Cami called in to request.  I brought food, knowing that I would probably not be able to eat much of anything they served, but we'd expected Cami would at least be able to eat a meal on the flight.

The funniest part of the flight was being told by a flight attendant that we're a cute couple, and that if we ever decide to "breed" we'd have good looking offspring.  Apparently she "can always tell."

We read, watched *Frozen* and *Anna Karenina*, and took a couple naps, and the flight went surprisingly quickly.

There wasn't much to look at out the window until the very end of the flight:

After getting our bags (they were ready immediately) and quickly going through immigration and customs we found our way to the Narita express where we spent ￥3000 (~$30) on two tickets to Yokohama 横浜.  The train ride was nice, and the weather was beautiful, though a typhoon is threatening Okinawa.  

We're staying with my wonderful cousin Katie, and while working late kept her from being able to pick us up, she left detailed instructions and pictures describing how to get to her apartment from the train station. Finding our way out of the station and to the apartment building was still somewhat difficult, thanks to our sleep deprived minds, but we made it!  

We've tried to catch up on sleep and woke up to the edges of the typhoon which have robbed us of a view of Mt. Fuji:
