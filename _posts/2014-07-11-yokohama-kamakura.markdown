__7/9__

On our first full day in Japan we started the day off right with a run in the morning mist and fog of Yokohama along the water. It was still pretty warm for us, even with the slight rain. But, it was a nice way to start the day.

We both woke up around 4am and while I was able to fall back asleep for a couple hours, Tim stayed awake working on our blog. :)

By the time we ran, showered and got ready to go it was lunch time. Katie took us to The Landmark Tower (a 10 minute walk from her place) to search for a place to eat. The building was formerly the tallest in Japan and has literally hundreds of places to eat. In Japan, they often have pictures of the food outside the restaurant or plastic versions of the dishes they serve, which look remarkably similar to the actual dishes. This has been really helpful for Tim and I as our diets are so restricting. We wandered around for awhile perusing the plastic dishes and pictures of food. We decided against a Japanese restaurant that was around $70 a plate and headed to the basement of the building where dozens of restaurants were located. We ended up at a place where we all shared a huge platter of raw fish and had rice on the side. It’s the most fish I’ve ever eaten in one sitting.

We were pretty tired that afternoon and mostly just relaxed, and did some grocery shopping so we can cook from Katie’s some of the time. At night, Katie’s friend Christina arrived and we all went out to dinner. On our way home from dinner we took a taxi because it was raining pretty hard. Taxi doors are automatic here, and when Tim went to close the door he was yelled at by the taxi driver. Apparently that’s not allowed!

Another early morning run, but with no rain this time which resulted in a lot more sweat! With a typhoon on the horizon, we decided to stay closer to Yokohama rather than venturing to Hiroshima as we had previously planned. We made breakfast at Katie’s then took a train to the nearby coastal town of Kamakura (about a 30 minute ride). Kamakura is known for its Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, so we spent our day exploring a few of these.

After walking down a “Shopping Street” full of shops and food, we explored Tsurugaoka Hachimangu shrine. The shrine was huge with lots of different areas to explore including lotus ponds (with koi fish, turtles, and pigeons surrounding it), gardens, structures, and many mini shrines within the large shrine itself. We spent a long time exploring all the nooks and crannies and taking lots of pictures.

We then headed back through the shopping street where I had some mango juice and a purple sweet potato flavored Kintsuba (Japanese sweet)

Katie and Christina had sweet potato flavored ice cream. The sweet potatoes here are purple, so both of these treats were purple in color as well. We also found a Portland store!

We headed back to the train station where we took a 5 minute train to a different part of Kamakura to see The Great Buddha - which is the 2nd largest Buddha in Japan. It’s made of bronze and is within the Kotokuin temple. We were even able to go inside the buddha and see how they’ve scaffolded and re-structured on the inside to maintain its structural soundness after hundreds of years.

We then walked to one more temple for the day - Hasedera. Which is known for its statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy (the largest wooden structure in Japan), its views of the beach and ocean, and for the hydrangeas which bloom all over the place in an area of the temple. Katie told us, a couple weeks ago when the hydrangeas were in full bloom, there was a 75 minute wait to walk up with all the hydrangeas and the view. Luckily we didn’t have to wait at all and there were still lots of hydrangeas blooming to enjoy.

After our fish feast from the day before, I was ready for a vegetarian meal. Luckily since Kamakura is full of Zen Buddhists, there were options for us! We ended up going to a place that labels itself as a “Hemp Cafe.”

 If you can picture Japanese hippies, this is is who ran the restaurant. And their English was proficient enough to understand Tim’s dietary restrictions with wheat, although at first the cook thought we said “weed” as he made a gesture like he was smoking. We cleared that up by saying gluten and using some other descriptions, and he soon understood what we were talking about. I had a delicious set meal of vegetarian food - lots of veggie side dishes and a restaurant made hemp tempeh with tofu cheese on top.  We also tried some plum wine, made from local plums!

And, we had a nice view of the huge waves coming in on the shore as the tropical storm (no longer being labeled as as typhoon) was beginning to come in.

We then took the train back to Yokohama, and hunkered down for the evening since it was supposed to be blustery and rainy that night. We plan to head to Kyoto on Friday because the weather is supposed to clear by late morning.
